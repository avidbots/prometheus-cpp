/// \brief A metric of type T with a set of labeled dimensions.
///
/// One of Prometheus main feature is a multi-dimensional data model with time
/// series data identified by metric name and key/value pairs, also known as
/// labels. A time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or
/// graphed) in time order (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series).
///
/// An instance of this class is exposed as multiple time series during
/// scrape, i.e., one time series for each set of labels provided to Add().
///
/// For example it is possible to collect data for a metric
/// `http_requests_total`, with two time series:
///
/// - all HTTP requests that used the method POST
/// - all HTTP requests that used the method GET
///
/// The metric name specifies the general feature of a system that is
/// measured, e.g., `http_requests_total`. Labels enable Prometheus's
/// dimensional data model: any given combination of labels for the same
/// metric name identifies a particular dimensional instantiation of that
/// metric. For example a label for 'all HTTP requests that used the method
/// POST' can be assigned with `method= "POST"`.
///
/// Given a metric name and a set of labels, time series are frequently
/// identified using this notation:
///
///     <metric name> { < label name >= <label value>, ... }
///
/// It is required to follow the syntax of metric names and labels given by:
/// https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/#metric-names-and-labels
///
/// The following metric and label conventions are not required for using
/// Prometheus, but can serve as both a style-guide and a collection of best
/// practices: https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/
///
/// \tparam T One of the metric types Counter, Gauge, Histogram or Summary.
